This project is an educational web scraper for krisha.kz that collects apartment listings and saves them into a CSV file for further analysis.
In addition to parsing listing pages, the scraper also calls an internal API endpoint to retrieve recommended price estimates, allowing comparison between listed and model-based prices.
The project is intended for learning purposes only (HTTP sessions, parsing, basic ETL pipeline).
